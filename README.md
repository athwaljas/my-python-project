# Single Linear Regression Project
# Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Single Linear Regression model to predict students' scores based on the number of hours they studied. Using Python, libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn are utilized to preprocess data, visualize relationships, train the regression model, and evaluate its performance. The project also includes statistical metrics like R², Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error to assess the model's accuracy.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
* Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
* Libraries:
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - scikit-learn

# Installaion Instructions
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. i did this project on jupiter notebook launched from anaconda. 
follow these steps:
 * Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
 * Install the necessary dependencies using pip:
   *pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
 * Place the dataset file student_scores1.csv in the same directory as the script.


# Running the Tests
# Breakdown of Tests
The project includes the following tests:
* Data Visualization: Scatter plots and boxplots are generated to understand the relationship between study hours and scores.
* Model Training: A linear regression model is trained using scikit-learn.
* Model Evaluation: Metrics such as R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated to evaluate model performance.
* Forecast Table: A table is generated comparing actual scores with predicted ones, along with differences.

# To run these tests:
* Open a Jupiter Notebook terminal or Python IDE.
* Execute the script:

# Deployment
This project is designed for local execution. To deploy it on a server:
* Ensure Python and dependencies are installed on the server.
* Upload the script and dataset file to the server.
